I've created a comprehensive, modular security testing suite for the multi-signature wallet application. Here's a breakdown of the test files and their specific focus:

SecureKeyService Tests - Tests secure key generation, encryption, storage, retrieval, and sharing functionality.
HardwareWalletSecurity Tests - Tests hardware wallet transaction verification, risk analysis across multiple blockchains, and security features like dangerous contract detection.
KeyRecoveryService Tests - Tests social recovery, timelock recovery, and deadman switch mechanisms for wallet key recovery.
MultiSigService Tests - Tests multisig wallet creation, transaction proposal/signing/execution, and status checking for Ethereum and Bitcoin.
SecureVaultService Tests - Tests secure vault creation, vault item management, sharing controls, access logging, and backup/restore functionality.
Security Integration Tests - End-to-end tests that verify how multiple components work together, including wallet creation with recovery options, hardware wallet integration, secure storage, and complete recovery flows.
Test Index - A central index file that exports all security tests and provides commands for running specific test groups.

This modular approach makes the test suite:

More maintainable - Each file focuses on a specific service or functionality
Easier to debug - Issues can be isolated to specific components
More scalable - New test files can be added without bloating existing tests
Better documented - Each test file has clear descriptions of its purpose

The tests provide comprehensive coverage of critical security paths including:

Private key handling and encryption
Transaction signature validation
Multi-signature threshold enforcement
Hardware wallet integration
Social recovery mechanisms
Secure vault operations
