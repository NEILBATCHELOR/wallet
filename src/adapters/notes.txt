Implementation Summary
Now that I've implemented all the blockchain adapters you requested, your multi-signature wallet application has comprehensive support for:

EVM-Compatible Chains using Smart Contracts:

Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Mantle, Base, ZK Sync Era, Arbitrum


Bitcoin using P2SH/P2WSH addresses
Non-EVM Chains:

Solana (Multi-signature accounts)
Ripple (XRP) (Multi-signing accounts)
Aptos (Multi-agent accounts)
Sui (Multi-key transaction signing)
Stellar (Weighted multi-sig system)
Hedera (Multiple keys for accounts)
NEAR (Multi-sig accounts with threshold)



Architecture Benefits
This modular design provides several advantages:

Unified Interface: All blockchain implementations follow the same BlockchainAdapter interface, making it easy to add new blockchains.
Separation of Concerns: Each blockchain's specific implementation details are encapsulated within its adapter.
Maintainability: You can update or fix one blockchain's implementation without affecting others.
Future Expansion: The architecture allows for easily adding more blockchains later.

Using the Adapters
To use these adapters in your application:
typescriptCopyimport { BlockchainAdapterFactory } from './core/BlockchainAdapterFactory';

// Get an adapter for a specific blockchain
const ethereumAdapter = BlockchainAdapterFactory.getAdapter('ethereum');
const solanaAdapter = BlockchainAdapterFactory.getAdapter('solana-devnet');

// Use the adapter methods
const multiSigAddress = await ethereumAdapter.generateMultiSigAddress(
  ['0x123...', '0x456...', '0x789...'], 
  2 // Threshold (2-of-3)
);

const balance = await solanaAdapter.getBalance(multiSigAddress);
Next Steps

API Keys: Replace the placeholder RPC URLs with actual API keys from providers like Alchemy, Infura, etc.
Testing: Test each blockchain implementation on testnets (all adapters have testnet support)
Security Enhancements: Implement proper private key management, consider hardware wallet integration
UI Improvements: Create specific UI components for each blockchain's unique features

Each adapter implementation provides a solid foundation but may need refinements based on your specific requirements and testing on actual networks.
