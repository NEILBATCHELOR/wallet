Maximizing Key Security Across Blockchains
To maximize security for your multi-blockchain wallet, I recommend implementing a comprehensive security strategy that addresses key generation, signing operations, and storage. Here's a blueprint focusing on practical, robust security:

Key Generation Security
Hardware-Based Generation (Highest Security)
Hardware Security Modules (HSMs): Use dedicated HSMs for institutional-grade key generation
Hardware Wallets: Leverage Ledger or Trezor for consumer-grade security
Air-Gapped Computers: For extreme security, use computers that have never and will never connect to the internet
Software-Based Generation (When Hardware Isn't Available)
Secure Random Sources: Ensure cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNGs)
BIP-39 Implementation: Generate keys following BIP-39 standards with adequate entropy (≥128 bits)
Memory Protection: Clear memory after key generation to prevent cold boot attacks
typescript

Copy
// Example of secure key generation (for development use only)
// In production, prefer hardware solutions
function generateSecureKey() {
  // Use a CSPRNG, not Math.random()
  const array = new Uint8Array(32);
  window.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
  
  // Clear memory explicitly after use
  const cleanMemory = () => {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      array[i] = 0;
    }
  };
  
  try {
    return Buffer.from(array).toString('hex');
  } finally {
    cleanMemory();
  }
}
Signing Operations
Hardware-Based Signing
Never Expose Private Keys: Always keep keys in hardware security boundaries
Verify Transactions: Display transaction details on trusted hardware screens
Enforce Policies: Implement signing policies (e.g., transaction value limits, destination address whitelists)
Multi-Signature Implementation
N-of-M Threshold: Use appropriate thresholds (3-of-5 is recommended for high-value wallets)
Diverse Signers: Distribute keys across different technologies and physical locations
Time-Locks: Add time-locks for high-value transactions to allow cancellation
Per-Blockchain Signing Considerations
EVM Chains: Verify contract interactions using ABIs to decode function calls
Bitcoin: Use PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) for collaborative signing
Solana: Verify program invocations and account access
Aptos/Sui: Verify script execution details before signing
Key Storage Solutions
Best Practices by Key Type
1. Active Hot Wallets (Frequently Used)
Hardware Wallets: Connect only when needed for signing
Key Sharding: Split keys using Shamir's Secret Sharing (requires multiple fragments to reconstruct)
Secure Enclaves: For mobile applications, use TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) or secure enclaves
2. Cold Storage (Infrequently Used)
Air-Gapped Hardware: Keep cold wallets completely offline
Physical Metal Backups: Store seed phrases on metal (not paper) in secure locations
Multisig Vaults: Implement on-chain vaults requiring multiple approvals
3. Recovery Keys/Seed Phrases
Physical Separation: Store recovery information in different geographic locations
Encryption: Add passphrase protection (BIP-39 passphrases)
Tamper-Evident Storage: Use security seals to detect physical tampering

Advanced Security Measures

Key Recovery Systems
Social Recovery: Allow trusted contacts to help recover access
Timelock Recovery: Enable recovery after a waiting period
Dead Man's Switch: Automatic transfer of access after inactivity
Enterprise-Grade Security
MPC (Multi-Party Computation): Distribute key fragments using threshold cryptography
Quorum Approval: Require organizational hierarchy approval
Audit Logging: Record all signing attempts (successful or not)
Practical Implementation Example
typescript

Copy
// Example of a secure signing workflow
async function secureSigningWorkflow(transaction, walletType) {
  // 1. Transaction preparation (online environment)
  const unsignedTx = prepareTransaction(transaction);
  
  // 2. Generate QR code or file for airgap transfer
  const serializedTx = serializeForAirgap(unsignedTx);
  
  // 3. Sign in secure environment
  let signedTx;
  
  switch (walletType) {
    case 'ledger':
      // Use our Ledger integration
      signedTx = await signWithLedger(unsignedTx);
      break;
      
    case 'airgap':
      // Wait for signature from airgapped device
      signedTx = await requestAirgapSignature(serializedTx);
      break;
      
    case 'mpc':
      // Distribute signing to multiple parties
      signedTx = await performMpcSigning(unsignedTx);
      break;
      
    default:
      throw new Error('Insecure signing method');
  }
  
  // 4. Verify signature before broadcasting
  if (!verifySignature(signedTx)) {
    throw new Error('Signature verification failed');
  }
  
  // 5. Broadcast transaction
  return broadcastTransaction(signedTx);
}
Blockchain-Specific Security Considerations

Ethereum (and EVM chains)
Verify contract calls using simulation before signing
Implement EIP-712 for structured data signing
Use hardware wallets with display capabilities for contract interactions

Bitcoin
Always use SegWit or Taproot addresses for improved security
Implement coin control to manage UTXOs
Verify change addresses on hardware wallet displays

Solana
Use hierarchical derivation for subaccounts
Verify program IDs before signing instructions
Implement rent-exempt checks for accounts
Newer Chains (Aptos, Sui, NEAR)
Stay updated with security best practices as they evolve
Implement chain-specific verification for novel transaction types
Test signing implementations thoroughly before production use
By implementing these practices, your multi-blockchain wallet will provide institutional-grade security for key management while maintaining a practical user experience.
