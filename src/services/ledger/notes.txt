Ledger Hardware Wallet Integration Summary
I've implemented a comprehensive Ledger hardware wallet integration for your multi-signature wallet application, supporting all the blockchains you specified. Here's a summary of what's been added:
Core Ledger Services

Base Ledger Service: Handles connection and communication with Ledger devices using WebUSB and WebHID.
Blockchain-Specific Ledger Services:

Ethereum/EVM: For Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Base, ZK Sync, Arbitrum, and Mantle
Bitcoin: For Bitcoin and related chains
Solana: For Solana blockchain


React Hooks: The useLedger hook provides a unified interface for interacting with Ledger in React components.

UI Components

LedgerConnect: A component for connecting to Ledger devices and selecting addresses.
LedgerTransactionSigner: A component for signing transactions with Ledger.

Integration with Multi-Signature Wallet

useMultiSigWalletLedger: A custom hook that combines the multi-signature wallet functionality with Ledger support.
LedgerTransactionSigner Component: For signing multi-signature transactions with Ledger.

Implementation Details

Auto-Detection: The system automatically detects the appropriate Ledger app to use based on the blockchain.
Multiple Addresses: Users can choose from multiple derived addresses.
Address Verification: Users can verify addresses on their Ledger device.
Transaction Details: Transactions are displayed for review before signing.
Transaction Signing: Signatures are created on the Ledger device, keeping private keys secure.

How to Use

Connect a Ledger Device:
jsxCopy<LedgerConnect 
  appType="ethereum" 
  onAddressSelect={(address, path) => console.log(address, path)}
  onConnect={() => console.log("Connected")}
/>

Sign a Transaction:
jsxCopy// In your component where you need to sign a transaction
const { 
  signProposalWithLedger, 
  ledgerAddress 
} = useMultiSigWalletLedger({ walletId });

// When user wants to sign with Ledger
if (ledgerAddress) {
  await signProposalWithLedger(proposalId);
} else {
  // Show the Ledger connection UI
}


Security Considerations

Private keys never leave the Ledger device
All transaction signing happens on the device
Users verify transaction details on the device display
Supports all Ledger security features like PIN protection

This implementation gives your users a secure way to participate in multi-signature wallet operations without exposing their private keys to the browser, significantly enhancing the security of your application.
